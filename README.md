The principal reason to make this repository were
- to practice to interviews
- To get Feedback from other developers
- To improve my skills to use Kotlin and be a better android developer
- To help other developers that want to view exercises of data structures in Kotlin

## NOTES
- If anyone wants to make me a correction, feel free to let me know in my email or with a pull request
- This repository will keep updating as I keep practicing and saving my exercises
